{"rating": "5.0", "review": " After my 5 days of use I am writing this review based on my own experience - The phone is a Beast The main highlight of this phone is the performance you can compare it with any phone under 15k and it will come out to be better, the Helio p60 processor which is based on 12nm technology is a beast in this price segment the gaming performance is just wow you wouldn't see any frame drop while playing games. The camera quality is also very good as you can see in the above picture i have given a sample and the battery backup is brilliant even though it is a 3410mAh battery still it can give competition to a 4000mAh battery phone I dont know how but its brilliant. The only thing that it misses out is the fingerprint scanner but I never felt the lack of it because the face unlock in this device is working very fast and accurately.  "},
{"rating": "5.0", "review": " I purchased this phone on 25 may. Phone that will blow your mind.. Pros - 1) Helio p60 processor with AI capabilities ( this makes your phone a performance beast. AI features are the cake to the icing). 2) 6 GB ram and 128 GB storage. (Makes multi tasks easy and navigation fluidic and you don't need to worry about space). 3) front camera is great and back camera ok. 4) color os - very use friendly and hell lots of customisation. As it has an AI powered processor, you get lots of features for your convenience, navigation gestures, screen off gestures works really well. 5) superfast face unlock. You won't miss fingerprint sensor at all. Unless you are in really dark environment. 6) intelligent gallery. ( Photos gets sorted out automatically based on people, places and time) 7) battery - you get 1.25 days out of it easily. 8) dual 4g and volte support is very useful as I use 2 4g sims ( Airtel and jio) 9) display too is good and have decent colour reproduction. 10) no lag or heating while playing or recording 1080p videos. Cons: 1) no fingerprint sensor 2) no gorilla glass ( but it comes with tempered glass screen protector already applied, so no need to worry) 3) no notification led. This sucks. They could have added it, it's frustrating. 4) face unlock works even with your eyes closed and that is really a security threat. Hope oppo would release an update sorting it out. 5)sound output From the speakers requires refinement. On the whole.. I love this phone, it has limitations.  "},
{"rating": "5.0", "review": " Nice phone at this price range, 3+32 gb version for 8990. This phone has good qualities. 1- camera- front camera is very nice and AI beauty mode is superfine, front camera captures details very well. 2- 3410 mah battery is good, 3- design- realme1 design is so impressive and slim sleek design makes this phone premium. 4- back glass diamond cut design makes this phone premium in this class 5- value for money- what can u expect at introductory price range 8990 (3+32 version) 6- performance- helio p60 processor is equivalent to snapdragon 660 and meet the all power management requirements. 7- audio- nice earpiece volume,nice headphone sound, nice speaker quality. 8- display- display is quite well and very saturated colors.

{"rating": "4.0", "review": " Directly comming to conclusion Pros:- 1. Great display, i feel it is better than my honor 6x. 2. 16.9 ratio is nice to have 3. Camera quality front and back are acceptable 4. Build quality is good, however not sure if it can survive accidental drops in long run. 5. Screen fitted guard and back cover provided. 6. Dual 4g sim can be used and both running in 4g 7. Performance is definitely great. Fast app loading 8. Light weight, compact, great looking 9. Color os has good number of customization, icons interface similar to iphone. Navigation gestures. Quick ball 10. Dedicated memory card slot, which is why i purchased this phone. 11. The audio quality through earphone is great.  Cons:- 1.I feel that memory management is not done properly. For example switching between apps or when app is minimised to look into a different app, reloads the app.. So it will hamper experience of filling out a form or  registration, if the app reloads you need to enter all details again that was entered. This has been reported to oppo hopefully they can release a fix.  "},
{"rating": "2.0", "review": " Phone has decent performance and features. It heats up a little when using the camera app with stickers for a while. Haven't faced any lags or other issues yet. Dual 4G works fine, call quality is good. The major drawback of this device is that the memory management is very very poor, which means pathetic multitasking performance. Even my backup phone with 1GB RAM performs better. Apps reload if minimized and then accessed again, it causes issues with filling forms and retrieving OTP while performing online transactions. Most apps reloads if you minimise to check the OTP which is rather annoying. Hopefully they'll fix this in the coming weeks with an update. Will change the rating if they fix this issue, else will have to get rid of this phone. "},
{"rating": "4.0", "review": " Pros:- 1)Large screen to body ratio 2)well implementation of volume broker buttons and power on off button 3) screen quality is also great 4) brightness level for using handset outside is very good 5)  silicon cover is provided in the package itself 6) preapplied screen protector is very good 7) retaining 3.5 mm audio jack 8) option for split screen for apps supporting the same 9) cloning application for making the clone from your old android or ios device to this new realme 1 phone 10) dual app support 11) new hands on colour OS by Realme 12) AI works well for unlocking within micro seconds 13) assistive ball for quick actions on any screen 14) various stickers and  modes in camera application 15) sound output from speaker downside is also good 16)call reception quality is very good 17) dedicated 3 slots for 2 sim and 1 memory card 18) secure payment environment provided for payment apps like paytm .etc 19) the looks of the smartphone is emersive and premium. 20) dual true 4g volte support 21) gaming acceleration mode works well  Cons:- 1) no dedicated fingerprint sensor 2) camera quality for both front and back sensors is average regards being had to the price range and its competition from same range smartphones.(big concern) 3) battery life is not that well:-if you are a video lover or a gaming enthusiast then you woukd be required to charge the device twice or may be more depending on your usage of the on screen time and brightness levels 4) no support for fast charging even for price range of Rs.14000 5)No dedicated notification light on the front of mobile 6) if you swipe down on home screen you will get search option and not the notification panel itself. Which is bit annoying some times .....only solution is to make assistive ball feature activated for the same.(annoying) 7) the sim tray fells to be made up of plastic and looks fragile . 8) No system updates even after 1 week of purchase or no security updates till now( awaiting) 9) PIN Lock system requires 6 digits which becomes annoying at very dim lighting when the face unlock doesn't work well. 10) No option for Reboot(direct),only Power off option is available 11) the space taken up by the on screen navigation buttons at the bottom of the smartphone looks to be bit more the usually for on screen usage 12) The face unlock feature may be a serious concern as one who looks like you may unlock it pretty easily ( my real brother had facial features like me so the smartphone cant differentiate beteen us and unlocks the mobile easily) 13) after using it for one week , i am getting a notification for downloading English (UK) by downloading manager and still even after 2 days it is not going away and no solution to it is given ....... Nothing opens up when i clicks on the notification in notification bar.( Really annoying) 14) the back of the smartphone is fingerprint magnet and it gets really smuggy if you dont clean it regularly or use a cover 15) same is for the front screen protector ....it too gets fingerprints and had to wipe it clean most of the times 16) when you chage sims whule the phone is still ON then the system itself reboots to work with the sims( annoying) 17) if you install any application that uses device administrator settings the if you allow it .....then a persistent notification shows up in notification panel which is unwantted itself (annoying). 18) for collapsing/closing the notification from panel you are to swipe leftand then choose delete.......no feature provided for users convenience to collapse the notifications just with left/right swipe .....or you have to select cross at the bottom of panel to close all notifications at once. 19) there is very less Widgets for sceen under the setting ........no support for widget for onscreen big digital clock 20) the effects for screen change is also limited 21) themes under the theme store are also limited 22) limited storage for cloud space 23) photos in the photos application are managed as new photos to the bottom and old photos at the top( quite annoying) 24) placement of audio jack is of concern when you are to hold the phone with earphones plugged into it.

Battery: 9/10 (one time charge, it's give 7-9 hours continuously usage &amp; it's average time 15 to 17 hrs backup) Good Battery life. 4. Face Unlock: 10/10 ( OMG! really its face unlock is enough, no need to fingerprint sensor!! B'coz Face Unlock in this phone is truly work hard and fine detect in very low lighting condition or some times in dark so.) 5. Sound: 9/10 ( Sound quality in this phone is good for music listening, on calls and mic is also very well, but it should be more louder) 5. Processor: 10/10 ( Mediatek Helio P60 is very very fast processor and all of your task runs smoothly, no any lag and heating problems) 6. Design &amp; Build : 9/10 (Its black diamond cut design is so glossy look and you feel premium. It has no metal construction on this phone but don't be worried about it, It has fiber glass body and will not break in daily usage fall) . Overall it's Unbeatable Smartphone at Unbelievable Price. Go for Its 3+32 GB of variant.

{"rating": "4.0", "review": " 4 star - missing finger print sensor. Ordered this on 25th may. Delivery was quite fast (it was less than 48 Hrs). Initially I was very much confused between 3GB/32GB and 6GB/128GB. As this phone comes with a dedicated memory card slot, a 32GB would have been enough for me, but I choose 6GB variant over it as it would give more power to your CPU.( Run by Media Tek P-60 chipset based on latest 12nm FINFET- faster and consuming less power, no heating issue.)  One thing was also in mind that it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor. That security is replaced by face unlocking feature. You may search it on YouTube about its reviews. It's very fast and accurate.(only one face can be registered at a time) Coming to its Camera- it is having single 13MP rear  and 8MP front facing camera. I would say it snaps shots well. It is also having bokeh effect- a must camera feature now a days- which is found only on multi lens rear camera phones now a days. The phone does it brilliantly- thanks to its power full processor.  It's screen (6inch 18:9 ) having bright FullHD. Only Con I found- missing the finger print sensor. Conclusion- You will get best hardware in this price range. Best for gaming lovers, good camera, decent battery.  "},
{"rating": "1.0", "review": " Not recommended even for the price Range. 9000. This phone is plagued with issues like- 1. Poor Ram management 2. Useless Oppo bloatware and the inability to disable them 3. Ineffective face lock which can not unlock the phone in dim lit environment yet unlocks when you have your eyes closed. 4. There is a lack of customising ability in this phone because the software has been made so rigid. You can't use 3rd party apps for a bunch of things including messaging. 5. As a result of the poor RAM management, the phone's so-called \"AI battery saving\" ability shuts down every single app including 3rd party alarm apps resulting in no activation of the alarm the next day.  This phone is a culmination of everything the stock Android experience is not. Poor iPhone ripoff. If you're going to rip something off, atleast do that properly. "},

{"rating": "5.0", "review": " Hi there  was eagerly waiting for this sale to come up and buy this phone eversince i watched the launch event. The phone is such a value for money product at this price .  I don\u2019t like spending much on phones but don\u2019t want to visit service centers often, because you know some of the mid-range smartphones are really bad. But I can say that I have made the right choice by buying the RealMe 1. It\u2019s worth your every hard-earned penny.  In the box you get - * Phone itself * Screen protector * Silicon cover * Sim ejector tool * User guides * Charger with cable  Build - ------ First talking about the build quality , the phone comes with a fiber glass back and i got the lava red color that just looks dope with the black front glass . The buttons are clicky and gives good feedback , everything is in place except the fingerprint that is missing , i really wish they had included that . but the faceunlock is just superb . it compensates for it and delivers even in very low light situation.  UI  - ---- It runs on color os and is on android 8.1 that is the latest and i don't think competition has even got 8.0 in this price . the phone runs smooth even though it is having the skin . there is no bloatware and i was impressed to see that . app opens quickly and overall the phone is very very responsive .  Hardware - -------- Now coming on to the main USP of this product - The Helio P60 , an octacore beast of a processor running 4 A53 and 4 A73 high power cores . it is having AI capabilities with dedicated cores and beats anything that comes in this price range . it is the flagship processor and comes in this budget phone that is just impressive. it can play games without any issue and there is very less heating in my usage . the chipset is one of a kind from mediatek and this time they are giving tough competition . for this chipset at this price hands down to oppo.  Camera - --------  This was unexpected but the cameras performs really good , the pictures are having good dynamic range and overall sharp even in very low light conditions , front camera is too good and selfies comes out be great ! Camera is fast and having expert mode where all the magic happens , use the Ultra HD mode and they pictures comes out to be very sharp and natural color tone . it is having AI features even in the camera and that can enhance the pictures a lot .  Batter life - ----------  The 3400 mAh battery gives you more than 1 day of battery on average usage and you can expect to last 1 full day on heavy usage . The charging is also fast , it gets fully charged in around 2 hours and that is also a plus point ,  Overall the user experience in last 3 days was amazing , no problem till now , only thing missing is fingerprint sensor , but for me that isn't a problem as Faceunlock works very well . The camera does the job better than any in this price and even higher priced then this . Oppo has really pulled the game with this device and this is good for the consumers and we can expect a lot from other manufacturers to bring this performance at budget . Without a doubt you can go with this product. I will update review after 1 week.  Hope this helped   "},

Oppo has said that they have done different drop test on this phone. So this means it is durable  \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffbThe camera at the back rarelyl comes out from the chasis so there's no abstraction while placing it on the table. They have provided the SIM tray and the power button on the right side of smartphone.Both SIM and the microSD can be used simultaneously. no fingerprint sensor is present in this phone. face detect feature is very fast but it becomes difficult in the dark. another thing that I noticed about the Face unlock is that it was when the eyes are closed. so anyone can open the smartphone while you are sleeping.  specification- (9/10) \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffbit comes with a MediaTek helio p60 processor which comes with the clock speed of 2.0 gigahertz. there are three variant available and I purchase 6 GB variant. it comes with a 128 GB storage in which we get 106 GB free out of the box. This processor gives a tough competition to snapdragon 636. it has 6 inches full HD plus display which has a resolution (1080x2160). it is an aspect ratio of 18:9. I watched one movie on it and experience was satisfactory. Non removable  3410mAh battery is present and comes with color OS. Android 8.1 version is present inside it.  Performance software and battery life- Software (7/10), Performance(8.5/10), Battery (8.5/10) \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffbthe 6 GB variant handled all the task from basic like taking pictures browsing the web,watching videos to the extream load like gaming very easily. I tested 3 high endgames on it and the maximum temperature I noticed was 45 degree centigrade. there was no dropping off the frame.  I managed to get 136821( image attached) on AnTuTu Benchmark. \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb it has highly modified colour OS 5.0 on Android 8.1 Oreo. various features are present like three finger screenshot, themes and lock screen gestures. \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb I charge it 100% and then use it continuously, I got 11 hours 8 minutes runtime.it do not support quick charging ,to charge it fully it takes around 2.4 to 3 hours.  Camera- (7/10) 13 megapixel rear camera comes with a single LED flash. camera application is very easy to use, various modes are provided Lake Panorama time lapse, stickers. a Pro mode is also provided so ISO exposure aperture and some other settings. I tested the phone camera in both lightning condition, bright daylight and bulb light. it performs really good in bright light but struggle in low light. I uploaded some pic for refrence. we can capture bokeh effect photographs from both the cameras as it uses artificial intelligence for doing aur judging Depth.  the artificial intelligence speed stickers are good for girls and boys can also have fun with it.  my opinion- (8/10)\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb considering the unique design good performance, 6 GB RAM decent battery life, good display and separate MicroSD card slot makes it a Nice combination. One can consider the absence of fingerprint sensor.  Pros-\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb has good battery life comes with a different design great in terms of performance  Cons-\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb average camera no fingerprint sensor  Hope now can make a decision. if any doubt ask in comments\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb  "},
{"rating": "4.0", "review": " Hey, guys bought this phone in the flash sale which was on 25th May 2018. I have bought the 3GB RAM+ 32GB ROM variant, so let me start with my review.  # Box Contents:- It comes in a very safe packing and in the box, you will get the Phone, a TPU case, sim ejector tool, user manual, power adapter and the USB cable.  # Design:- The design of the phone is the best in the bottom you will get the USB port, 3.5 mm Jack &amp; speaker grill.  * In the right side you will get the power button and sim card and SD card tray.  * In the left you will get the volume button + -  * The size of the screen is 6 inch and in the back part the phone is having a nice fibre and it is having a nice glossy finishing.  # Display:- The size of the screen is 6 inch (18:9 ratio) &amp; it is fhd display which is great, it is very crisp and clear and the viewing angles are also good.  # Slots:- It is having a triple slot in which you can insert your 2 sim cards and 1 SD card too so there is no issue of storage even if you are buying the 32 GB variant. (Image attached)  # Speaker:- The speaker is very loud and clear, it's sound is very crisp.  # Camera:- The rear camera is 13 MP and the performance of the camera is good but in low light, the performance is not that great. (images attached)  * The front camera is of 8 MP and it is having many features like Artificial intelligence (AI shot), Vivid mode and bokeh mode.  * Many filters also come with the camera app.  #Face unlock :- Yes the phone is missing the fingerprint scanner but the face unlock works great it's very fast, I have OnePlus 5 the speed of the face unlock of realme is almost the same speed of the face unlock of OnePlus 5.  Battery:- It is having 3410 mAh battery if you are using it normally for the whole day the battery will last for the whole day or more than a day.  * Charging time:- I have charged this from 20% to 100% and the time took was 2 hrs 15 mins.  * If you are using it regularly like playing games, watching movies etc and 4G is also on then the battery will last for around 7-8 hours.  # Operating system &amp; processor:- It comes with an Android version 8.1 Oreo out of the box and the processor is 2GHz Helio P60 AI.  Gaming Performance:- I have installed high-end games like PUBG (Players unknown battleground), NFS Most Wanted, modern combat 5.  *My gameplay with pubg in this phone was not that much smooth a sudden lag comes in between which spoils the entire gameplay even it was on low graphics.  * While in other games like NFS Most Wanted &amp; Modern Combat 5 it was very smooth.  * It is also having Game acceleration mode in which you can boost the performance of your game. (image attached)  Well keeping the price point of Rs 8990, this is a great phone at this price point with many features like face unlock, 6-inch screen, a beautiful build quality, great processor and many more features.  # I am reducing 1 \ud83c\udf1f as the back part of the phone is a dust magnet and fingerprint magnet.  At this price point, this is a great phone, recommended.  Thank you for reading my review.  Regards, Nishant Lala.  "},

{"rating": "5.0", "review": " Realme 1 is a relatively cheap phone from OPPO. I purchased the black 3 + 32 GB variant from amazon. The price is Rs. 8990. The phone looks good, hardware are OK. There is face unlock, still I miss the fingerprint unlock. The good thing is it has dedicated SD card slot along with two 4g volte sim slots.  Powered by an octa-core MediaTek Helio P60 chipset and 3GB of RAM, the Realme 1 is based on Android Oreo. The smartphone features a 6-inch Full HD+ display and ships with 32GB of expandable internal storage space. Armed with a 13MP rear and an 8MP front-facing shooter, the device is fuelled by a 3,410mAh battery. I am using the phone just for a couple of days\u2026\u2026. my initial impression about the phone is as follows: Things I like: 1. The display: 18:9, with good adaptive brightness 2. The Sound: Clear and loud 3. The 8 MP Front Camera: takes brilliant good looking selfies 4. System: Latest android Oreo out of the box. 5. Hardware: Fast and the latest Octa-core Mediatek  P60 processor, 32 GB internal memory and 3 GB RAM\u2026.the specs are at per with any budget phone. 6. The Look: Slim and classy. Light weight. The back side of the phone looks brilliant with its glossy finish. On the front side the bezels are really thin, that makes the 6 inch screen fit to your palm easily 7. Realme 1 comes with a good quality clear back cover absolutely free. The phone also comes with a scratch guard applied on the screen. That means the phone is ready to use\u2026.you don\u2019t have to rush to buy cases and screen guards just after getting the phone. 8. Dedicated SD Card Slot plus two 4G Volte SIM Slots. Thanks, that they haven\u2019t used the useless hybrid slots. 9. All the sensors like the proximity, Gyro, Accelerometer etc. are present.  Things I don\u2019t like: 1. The 13 MP rear camera: Ordinary, in the age of dual cameras. I expected better as Oppo is known for its camera quality. \u2026though the videos taken are good enough. 2. Missing the fingerprint sensor: Though the phone is equipped with face unlock, still\u2026\u2026the more the merrier.  My Verdict: From the price point ratio, if you are an OPPO fan, this is the best you can get. A good phone that comes under sub 10k price-band category. But, certainly, this is still not a Xiaomi killer. p. s. -  Please like my review if you find it useful. you may ask me any questions about the phone, I'll be happy to answer your queries.  "},
{"rating": "5.0", "review": " The wait was finally over and this definitely is a flagship killer. Inside the box you'll find 1. The handset with screen guard (applied on the device) 2. charging brick 5V 2A 3. micro USB data cable 4. sim ejector tool 5. Quick guide 6. safety guide 7. Protective case  Specs &gt;I bought the diamond black vith 3 GB RAM and 32 GB internal memory variant (also comes in 6 and 64 variant) &gt;IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen 6 inch full hd touch screen with 18:9 aspect ratio &gt;Android 8.1 (Oreo) &gt;Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass sensors &gt;3410 mAH battery &gt;Dual nano sim + dedicated micro sd card slot  &gt;Description I was expecting a much more cheap plastic feel to it but the phone actually feels premium,rigid and slim, the back is having a reflective diamond cut pattern design and is non removable and the device houses a Mediatek MT6771 Helio P60 chipset. On the left side is the volume rocker and on the right side is the power button, there are no buttons or slots on top, you'll find the speaker, charging slot, audio jack and the mic at the bottom of the device.Highlighted features of the device include face unlock which works very swiftly even in dim lighting, but it does seem to fail in dark surroundings, as a backup they have included a pin lock in case the face unlock fails. The device comes with Android 8.1 (Oreo) out the box with colorOS. The display is very good and has thin bezels, The phone sports a 13 mega pixel main camera with led flash and an 8 mega pixel front facing camera which produces superb image quality along with face recognition and AI features The sim tray can house 2 4g sim cards and a dedicated micro sd card( upto 256 GB) I also think that they could've included a finger print sensor and use type c cable. which would've been a killer combination in this range. still the device is worth every penny spent and there is no compromise made on the quality of the device  Verdict The device certainly sets new standards for budget phones in the price range For people looking for good feature full camera and descent battery life on a budget this is one of the best out there.

{"rating": "4.0", "review": " This phone on paper does seem to meet all my needs and more specifically at a price which is simply extraordinary. I got the 6GB + 128GB ram, as an Indian value seeker shopper the value to me seems to be simply unprecedented. But first things first, lets go through the review below to find out how this is such a great phone in comparison to a whole lot of other mid-end phones.  Whats in the Box? :  1) OPPO Realme 1 Phone 2) 2.0A Charger 3) USB to microUSB cable 4) TPU Cover for the Phone 5) Pin for Sim Tray 6) Guide and Warranty Paper  ====================================================================================================================================  Lets talk about the SPECIFICATION and what it means in detail a bit :  Processor : 2GHz Helio P60 which is almost equivalent to Snapdragon 660. I dont play games, but I also do not close applications which accumulate to 40-50 at times and tend to slow down other mid end phones like Honor 6x that I have used before. Fortunately that is not the case here, be it for the processor or Ram but its a welcome change, and the speed meets my requirement.  Camera : 13MP Back Camera + 8 MP Front Camera. Ofcourse megapixels are not everything, but it seems to me it might be lagging behind the competition in this department. Do read below to find my views on this further.  Battery : 3410mAH li-on battery which should suffice for a days use.  Weight : At 154gms its pretty well balanced but its pretty thick at .8cm (.31 inches)  ====================================================================================================================================  After the specifications, lets talk about the various FEATURES of the phone and how they stand up to my requirement :  Physical Looks (10/10): This phone is pretty symmetrical which I like very much. Top panel and bottom chin have the exact same dimension atleast at a quick glance. Its unique pattern in premium looking glass back design though attracts a lot of fingerprint, however it definitely has the diamond effect that the product page shows. And as I stated earlier definitely gives this phone a unmistakenly premium look. I am really in double mind if I want to use the transparent TPU cover which hides this unique back.  Charging (6/10): Now this is where I am completely disappointed by OPPO, specially because the charger looks exactly like what came with OnePlus 3T, and since both OPPO and Oneplus have the same parent company I was hoping it would have some kind of fast charging, but alas its a standard 2A charger and the phone has a standard micro USB slot.  Face Facial Unlock (9/10) : Before talking about Face Login which is amazingly fast, lets talk about the missing finger print scanner. So this phone does not have finger print login, now that is a glaring ommission in todays age, specially since even though speed of Face Facial Unlock keeps up with even my OnePlus 6, however in low light its completely useless (just like with other much costlier phones). Although it seems pretty frivolous to complain about a missing convenience feature but anyone who has grown accustomed to fast unlocks would definitely understand. But again, for the price of this phone, I can easily ignore this missing feature.  3 Slot Tray (10/10) : Now thats something I believe a few of the costlier phones should have. It has 2 4G Sim slots and a micro SD card slot which supports upto 256GB. Now that is simply wow.  Camera (7/10) : Since I am coming from OnePlus 6 hence I am a bit underwhelmed by the camera however for the price its undoubtedly brilliant. Specially the AR sticker feature comparable to snapchat filters recognizes faces very quick and works great. It adds pretty decent depth of field to potrait, but its quite clearly through software rather than the lenses doing their work. Camera has different mode like TIME-LAPSE, VIDEO, PHOTO, STICKER, PANO and EXPERT (where you get individual controls for White Balance, EV&lt; ISO, Shutter Speed and AF). I will try and update specifically about the Camera Focus Speed and Low light Capability of this phone in detail in a few days.  Comes with its own Backup Cloning Software so getting the phone up and running is pretty easy, however its not available on Playstore and the apk must be downloaded from their own link.  So overall I will end up saying its a great phone for the price at which you are getting at. It completely skips a few feature like Finger Printer scanner but then does a lot of things pretty good too like the looks and the extra Ram and Storage which you would not get at this price.  "},

{"rating": "5.0", "review": " I am in love with this phone!! Then again what's not to love! Every single aspect, be it the awesome FHD screen, the glossy &amp; fancy diamond design, the complimentary cover, the storage, the slots (that's 2 nano SIMs AND separate slot for memory card!), the strong battery, and I could go on!  I was totally mesmerized the first day and exploring the different aspects was a sheer delight. Kept tinkering with the settings, and there are so many of them for personalization! Yay!  This was my first Oppo phone so I was a bit wary of buying it. But now I am so glad I bought it!  However, there is 1 thing I do wish Oppo would fix. My biggest peeve is the absence of icons on the status bar for notifications. You get only 3 icons on it - battery, 4g &amp; wifi, NOTHING ELSE! So when you receive, say, a new message, you'll get a noise alert and it will be there in the notifications bar but there will be no corresponding symbol/icon on the status bar. It might not be a big deal for many but I do sorely miss this feature. Another small irritating feature is the inability to swipe the notifications in the notifications bar. So what you've here is an extra step. You've to swipe it to the left and then hit \"delete\" instead of just a swipe to remove the notification. Again, no big deal but it did matter to me.  These 2 minor reasons aside, this is a great phone! It's cool, stylish and definitely flaunt worthy!! :D If you're in the market for a new mobile, you'd be a fool not to buy it!  Must add, I just love its size. It is big but not too big and feels regal in the hands! That way, it has a expensive phone vibe but thankfully, is totally affordable.  I am now a Realme convert! Hail Oppo!  "},
{"rating": "4.0", "review": " I'm writing this review after using this phone for a week now, I got it in the very first sale; last week and I think now is the correct time to talk to you guys about this phone.  The package was delivered the very next day, thumbs up to Amazon for that.  In Box Contents : - Phone - Screen Protector - Silicon Case - Sim Ejector Tool - User Manual - Adapter &amp; Cable  I'll divide this review in 3 parts and will try to make this review as short as possible. LIKES : 1) The phone is light weight. 2) The12mm MediTek Helio P60 is best in class for this price. 3) Facial Unlocking actually works.(Most of the time.) 4) Beautiful Display, I love it. 5) AR Stickers are something you'll love exploring. 6) Decent Battery life, in my usage I was getting 7-8 hours of SOT. 7) Addition of pre-applied screen guard and a free case.  DISLIKES : 1) No Finger Print (Biometrics Sensor). 2) I honestly didn't like the User Interface, downloaded Nova Launcher. 3) Camera is good in natural lighting but really struggles in artificial and low lighting, its average I'd say. 4) No Fast Charging.  VERDICT : If you're having a budget of Rs.9000 close your eyes and buy this phone, there's no competition to this phone at the moment. You'll forget the missing finger print sensor in a day or two as you'll get used to facial unlocking.  Will update my review in near future if needed. Uploading some pictures for you to see how the device looks in hand. Thanks for spending your time reading my review hope it makes your buying decision simpler.  "},
{"rating": "4.0", "review": " Pros:  Eye-catching design on back and convincing glass feel. There's a dedicated MicroSD cars slot on the Dual SIM tray. The large 6-inch display has decent brightness, contrast and sunlight legibility along with the trendy 18:9 aspect ratio, rounded corners and even FullHD+ resolution. Color OS 5 is chuck-full of added features, some rarely found on budget devices. The MediaTek MT6771 Helio P60 chipset punches above its weight. It allows for mid-ranger levels of performance on a tight budget. You can't really do much better, performance-wise, in this price bracket  Cons:  No fingerprint reader No official info on any protective glass finish for the display. It feels well put together, but could be prone to scratches. No quick charging support. Color OS 5 might be feature-rich, but its menu and settings structure is very confusing and messy. Video capture is limited to 1080p@30fps. Kind of annoying, since the Helio P60 should be capable of 4K  Conclusion:  The Realme 1 is a smartphone that shows a lot of promise in certain areas, like the performance and the battery life, and features rich AI camera that\u2019s almost at-par with most phones in its price range. So, if you have a budget of around Rs. 9,000, the Realme 1 is a phone that you should definitely consider.  "},
{"rating": "5.0", "review": " #Therealreview #therealphone - realme1  I was very excited when I heard about this phone and waited for the launch and tried to get one but I missed on the sale it all went out in a jiffy and then I waited till the next sale watching all review in YouTube comparing it with all other phone's but this phone simply defeated all others with it's budget price and flagship specs! Finally I ordered it on the sale on June 1st which surprisingly started a long time before 12pm and I got it within 2 days very fast shipping provided! And I've been using since then......  ####### First is that fingerprint scanner which is not in the phone - In my experience - Face unlocking works better than fingerprint in this phone so you will not miss it! - yea some are saying it's not good as oneplus phone's face unlock because it unlocks even with eyes closed but did you see that oneplus phone's face lock can be easily fooled by a b&amp;w; photo? Realme my opinion it works it's own way and consider it's a budget phone and it's doing an excellent job ! - It can even unlock at night just increase the screen brightness!  ########second is the camera. I captured a lot of pics and I'll say it's best for the price - yeah yea it's not good in low light but it works perfectly in good light and captures high quality impressive images - It even have that depth effect even with that single camera! And it's capturing very good images! - It's flash is very bright - Shutter speed is fast. It comes in a pack of features that a person needed for the daily usage!  ##########Third is battery - It comes with 3410 mah battery which is average but I'm surprised by the results that it can simply last a day of hard usage without any problem even on 4g lte network. - I'm using the phone now from morning 8 and I've done a lot of things from playing music to lot of social stuff and even downloaded pubg,nfs mw, assassin's Creed identity,shadow fight 3 ,Riptide etc..and I used about 2-3 GB of internet on jio4g network and played played pubg for sometimes and now at 12:22pm it still at 67% #which is very good according to me ... I also have an s6 which overheats while playing pubg and drains battery very fast! - yea it doesn't support fast charging you but it will charge in a 1min - 1% count upto 50% and it  will take about 2hrs to fully charge !  ##########Fourth is performance - It's packed up with Helio p60 with GPU G72mp3 Which is Epic for the price! - At first I thought it will be bad because of the mtk processor that it's having and it blow my mind off by the new 12nm tech it is able to lower power consumption, lower heating and packed with enough power to even compete with latest snapdragon 660 which is only found in 30k phone's ... A 9k or 14k phone which is as powerful as 30k phone's How can this be more cool than that? - I can tell you this has no heating problem it's max temperature while gaming (after playing pubg at high setting) is 42\u00b0c. - Yea you'll feel some hotness while gaming at the top left corner because it's having a fibre back! And this fibre back eliminates the weight of the phone and give us that solar red look which is so good that the people will surely ask which phone is that!  #######fifth Built quality! - By having a fible glass and lack of gorilla glass back I was worried about the durability of the phone ! But I was wrong - Eventhough it's a tft screen it contain excellent image quality which I'm in love with! - It built very good that there is no bend or flex will be caused to the phone - yea it's a fingerprint magnet and you have to clean it in a while but you have to do some compromise for getting that looks by just putting that back cover provided with the phone Overall I surprised by the built quality because I thought it would be bad because of the low price!  ########Sixth The OS - It's coming with Colour OS with Android version 8.1 and will get update to Android P soon. - It comes with a lot of security features and a lot of themes and it's suspence you have to find it yourself! - If you don't like to type pin then there is the feature of pattern lock which can be found by clicking other encryption at modify passcode Inside face and passcode on settings! - Yeah there is the issue of cannot swipe to get rid of notification but you can still do it by swiping left and click delete and if you are lazy then click that x in circle to clear all notification in one go! Don't know about updates have not received on yet but they promised to give regular updates and even give Android P which is a great deal!  Some features - supports OTG ( Have to turn the otg support on in the settings) - True 4g LTE - bokeh effect - secure keyboard while typing passwords - 0.1s face unlock - split screen - Have game acceleration mode - AI beauty features - Have almost every sensors! - Have audio jack\ud83d\ude0b  Overall In my opinion this phone is a jackpot for this price and I can assure you will be completely satisfied!  If you have any doubt feel free to contact me at: sree.988711@gmail.com  "},
{"rating": "3.0", "review": " I bought this phone a week back, here is my review.  Looks - Amazing. glossy design yet simple. Performance - I used it very heavy - have also installed around 70 apps. Hanged only once. Most apps work fine. RAM management is extremely poor. It kills most apps in the background not sure why when it has 6gb memory. I have written to Oppo, realme on their twitter handles 4 days back, but they haven't even acknowledged the issue. So I assume customer service quality would be poor. I request more people to do the same so that the issue is highlighted and an update is sent. I am not a big fan of color OS. Options like 'keep wifi on when screen is off' do not exist. Battery - Battery is very good. With heavy use, I am left with 40 % charge at end of day. Camera - Camera quality is good. Yet to test it with low light. Beauty mode works like a charm. Network - I also use a oneplus and samsung at home. I have an airtel connection which is very weak in my area. When I use my sim card in oneplus it sucks up the battery but when I use it in this phone - no issue (Samsung also works well with airtel card). So I assume network catching capacity is good on this phone. Net speed is good and 4g works well. Decent phone if 14990 is your budget considering 6GB and 128 GB is offered.  "},
{"rating": "5.0", "review": " I got this phone for my wife. She loves taking selphies and since long time, I was looking for an affordable smartphone with great features.  Due to high prices of other competitors, we were delaying the buying decision.  When I heard about Realme phone first time, I didnt believe at all and that same night, I did a search for it online. Since, it was yet to launch, so I searched for reviews on YouTube.  After hearing the Industry experts, my confidence boosted and I made my decision to buy it finally.  The phone was delievered within 3-4 days at my home. On first look, it gives a premium look specially the back diamond cut design which makes it unique in its category.  Specifications are really good for this value for money gadget. I am getting 3GB 32Gb in 9000/- along with Advanced AI processor and oppo flagship brand. What more can you ask for?  Its powered by latest andriod version and 2GHz Mediatek Octa Core processor. I am not into gaming though but I can guarantee that it will not heat if you will do so.  The additional backcover was a surprise and made my day! Overall Its a strong contender in current market and will surely make other competitors to think !  "},
{"rating": "5.0", "review": " RealMe 1 is just Awesome!! Its a Beast in Performance, Look and Quality, what else needed! I wasn't really expecting a lot from this phone, as this is a new company, but now after using it I'm really very Happy. And right now I Switched to RealMe 1 from Samsung Galaxy S7 as this mobile beats S7 in all aspects. I have sorted out some Pros and Cons of this device, HAve a Look:  Pros:  + 2.5D Screen with Curve Corners makes it the best looking phone ever at this price! + Looks Premium and the 18:9 display is the best in this segment. + Good Blur and Brokeh effects even with Single Camera. + Quality Display with 2160*1080 Pixels(403 ppi). + Great Performance (Antutu Benchmark- 138321). + Slim and Light weight, feels great in hand. + Unique Diamond Design at the back. + Comes with Android Oreo Ready! + Vivid Color And Brightness.  Cons:  - No Fingerprint (But having Fast FaceUnlock) - Back portion gets dirty with finger marks - Battery lasting less than 24hours  I think this is the best Budget Smartphone right now with tons of features, I would recommend everyone to try this phone as this is one of the newest sub-brand of OPPO.

{"rating": "5.0", "review": " Performance Beast but it has limitations..  Colour: Diamond BlackStyle: 6 GB RAM  I purchased this phone on 25 may. Phone that will blow your mind.. Pros - 1) Helio p60 processor with AI capabilities ( this makes your phone a performance beast. AI features are the cake to the icing). 2) 6 GB ram and 128 GB storage. (Makes multi tasks easy and navigation fluidic and you don't need to worry about space). 3) front camera is great and back camera ok. 4) color os - very use friendly and hell lots of customisation. As it has an AI powered processor, you get lots of features for your convenience, navigation gestures, screen off gestures works really well. 5) superfast face unlock. You won't miss fingerprint sensor at all. Unless you are in really dark environment. 6) intelligent gallery. ( Photos gets sorted out automatically based on people, places and time) 7) battery - you get 1.25 days out of it easily. 8) dual 4g and volte support is very useful as I use 2 4g sims ( Airtel and jio) 9) display too is good and have decent colour reproduction. 10) no lag or heating while playing or recording 1080p videos. Cons: 1) no fingerprint sensor 2) no gorilla glass ( but it comes with tempered glass screen protector already applied, so no need to worry) 3) no notification led. This sucks. They could have added it, it's frustrating. 4) face unlock works even with your eyes closed and that is really a security threat. Hope oppo would release an update sorting it out. 5)sound output From the speakers requires refinement. On the whole.. I love this phone, it has limitation "},
{"rating": "5.0", "review": " I must say Woow what a phone, the features it offers in this price range is awesome, no other device feel as fast as this realme 1 this device can easily be compared with any flagship smartphone due to its features, you only can register one face ID is a flaw of this device but you will be amaze at the way it unlock the device easily in the dark too, the front camera will easily surprise you with the sharp details it captures and it also gets a bokeh effect on the front and at the rear, at the price what iv bought this device is seriously a steal deal, you watch many YouTube videos and none of a single YouTuber had said anything bad as the device already is the best performer in the mid range segment, im also impressed with the device battery output i  work  in automobile industry and i make and answer almost 25 to 30 calls with some photos and till the end of the day the device is left at 45 percent of battery that is amazing, you also get iPhone X like gestures that can be enabled in the device setting i  must say its an amazing device go ahead if you are planing for one.

{"rating": "5.0", "review": " Took a chance with this new brand/sub-brand and was pleasantly surprised. Phone was delivered the next day, no issues there as usual.  I got the 6/128GB version. The phone itself is quite good. The pre-installed screen guard is the first thing you will notice due to the edge against your finger when using the screen. It's the right size for me as most phones with this screen size tends to be broader. The phone is quite thin and light. Screen is very good. I initially thought the lack of fingerprint sensor would be an issue but the first time I used the phone (in daylight) I thought there was no lock mechanism as after putting the face unlock, the phone opened the moment I raised it to view the screen. The face unlock is that fast, to be completely unobtrusive. But at night and low light, it struggles and the need for a fingerprint sensor became obvious. There is a bit of bloatware as on cloning my old phone to the Realme, it only had about 3GB RAM free. The old phone with 3GB RAM used to have 1GB RAM free. It runs all apps, games etc with no issue and no heating. Battery life is very good. Again comparing my earlier Le2 phone, Realme has about 50% juice left where Le2 needed to be charged. This is with intermittent 4G, video playback, games, talktime etc. Absolutely no lag, no hangs etc till date in about 10 days of usage. One bonus is that a lot of features of my Moto 360 II which used to work intermittedly with Le2 works perfectly now. The camera is just OK, nothing to rave about. Both front and back shooters get the job done. The supplied softcase is bulky and I do not use it. The themes are quite good, though it is a gimmick. Extras like Google assistant work very well. Overall very happy.   "},
{"rating": "3.0", "review": "  RealMe 1 (Solar Red, 6+128 GB)  The Realme 1 is Oppo's first device in a brand new ultra-budget line and it's nothing short of a loud show of power.Not a bad phone . But fingerprint scanner and pattern lock are missing. While playing PUBG game, slightly hang on some place. over all good perfomence. The lack of led notification light is also a prblm for me. Battery perfomence is good. It also support dual 4g. We can use dual jio sim in the same time. Display is great. It does not support fast charging. Front camera is also a good one.To be honest though, the phone generally feels quite cheaply made \u2013 very plasticky and light (and not in the good way). The buttons are pretty flaky too and instead of a volume rocker, you get two individual buttons located inconveniently on the left of the device.That micro USB and cheap feel had set me up not to expect much when I first booted up the device. However, I was pleasantly surprised during set-up to discover the option for face unlock. This would be the result of the Helio P60 processor with its built-in NPU.The 6GB of RAM is also a generous choice for a budget handset, as is the 128GB of internal storage. Some users will be glad to see a hybrid SIM here too, which means there\u2019s the option to expand storage or add another SIM. And on the whole, performance seems perfectly adequate.So, this is a phone that is very much a budget device. It feels it and it looks it, despite Realme\u2019s best efforts with that weird pattern on the back panel. But there are also some cool features here that largely come down to the AI. And, at such a low price, this might just be enough for some punters  "},
{"rating": "5.0", "review": " if you want a phone only for harcore performance and bloody damm awesome music, go for this phone. but if you take lots of camera pics, this phone isnt for you. camera sucks alot. in day time it takes average pictures, and night time it has lots of noise. also oppo doesnt provide security updates, so don't expect that. front camera even with AI sucks, my brother bought redmi y1 the same day as i bought this and y1 camera is far better than this. battery is good. 3410 lasts almost 3/4th of the day. and coming to performance you wont find any phone under 17-18k with performance... far better than Zenfone max pro, note 5 pro, nokia x6, and all other phone in this segment. coming to music, i am a music enthusiastic... and believe me you wont find such good music anywhere. oppo has done a tremendous job on this one. it lacks the fingerprint scanner,  and face unlock doesnt works most of the time,have to try for few time then it unlock, also no notification light,that makes it bad too... overallod music and performance and decent camera go for it. but dont expect any updates anytime soon.

{"rating": "4.0", "review": " The phone is the best in its category. Pros: 1) 6 GB Ram helps to load the apps and games very quickly. 2) 128 GB is more than enough for an average user. 3) The Mediatek P60 Processor is really good and is really efficient in terms of multi tasking, battery management etc. 4) The cameras (both front and back) are really good and the Portrait Mode is really working well. 5) The Battery lasts for a day and a half after full charge. 6) The Gesture support is really good. 7) Face Unlock is really fast and responsive. 8) Really loud loudspeaker and the earphone volume is also great.   CONS: 1) It takes a bit time to adjust to Color OS. Also changes cant be made using Developer Options, which is only needed for Advanced Users. 2) Face Unlock does not work in extreme low light. Forget using face unlock while in bed with your lights off. You will have to manually enter the pass code to unlock. I will be updating further as I find any. So far Value for money. I have reduced a point due to Color OS. Stock Android would have been better.  "},
{"rating": "4.0", "review": " Hi all, My review is based after few days of usage. I brought 6gb ram and 128gb storage.Really its a value for money phone and It looks like oppoF7,But this is not a camera phone. Those who loves to click lots of pics this phone is a bit low. The hardware of the phone is stunning and lots of space for storage, No heating issues always my internet 4g is no. I used to play games. Battery will last for one day, And it didn't have fast charging compare to other phones the charging time is less. One thing Positive Feel premium look Less weight More onboard storage Value for money No heating issues Fast processor Negative No finger print sensor Face id works low in low light  "},
{"rating": "2.0", "review": " Pls beware before you buy this product. Go for 128GB instead of 32 GB variant. No doubt the hardware is very strong. But, software it comes with Color OS is very restrictive. Very poor RAM management with this version. My 4 years old Sony xperia mobile with 2GB RAM does better job than this. It keeps on clearing memory the moment you lock screen. Doesn't retain more than 3 to 4 apps in memory and force closes apps in background. Very frustrating, 32G model won't let you setup application startup, restricted to only 2 apps. By default 3apps are allowed i.e. facebook, WhatsApp and Mail. So, it only allows further 2 apps. One of the stupidest things I have seen on android device. Other very frustrating issues is it won't allow you to change sms app and forces you to use default app. Oppo keyboard keeps on showing up even when u change default keyboard to Gboard. Won't let any other app to be set as device administrator and the list goes own.  Horrible experience....!!  Software optimisation is a big deal with this device. Certainly, would stay away from OPPO. Android is good for one things refinement. Oppo device totally ruin it and to make things worse AMAZON won't refund. It's better to buy from market directly, why to buy here when no customer refund and support is available. I'm done ordering phones at AMAZON,  I Don't even understand how people are giving 4 stars. Pls give thumbs up if you find this helpful  "},
{"rating": "5.0", "review": " This phone has a great screen quality and good colour reproduction. I was using Moto z play before this and I didn't miss amoled screen at all. Kudos to oppo for that. The second good thing about this phone is battery life. Most people are not putting enough stress on this but battery life is equal to or better than that of a 4000 mah phone. It is certainly better than that of Honor 8 pro, Moto z play, tenor g and Redmi note 3. These are all the phones I have used and I find the battery backup to be excellent on this one. Idle drain is also very less on this phone, better than my Moto z play. Daylight photos are quite good and beyond expectations for this price range Software is the one thing that might irk a moderate to heavy user but if you are a casual user you will be very happy with the phone. I missed finger print scanner in the beginning but now I am ok with the facial recognition. The best feature according to me is the dual volte. My conclusion is that buy this one if you consume media and just want a full day battery phone where dual volte can be used.  "},

{"rating": "4.0", "review": " First time Oppo launched a flash sale on Amazon and  I grabbed it (Solar red as I am fond of red color). This phone is a great choice who loves speed and want to keep more data in phone. But a bit disappointment in term of camera which is pretty ordinary as compared to its peers (like Redmi note 5)  but as I understand to keep its cost optimized Oppo has not work much on the its camera. Again Delivery was excellent and It was delivered within 24 hours after ordering. Box contains a silicon cover, sim card bracket opening pin and 2Amp charger with normal USB cable and of course a nice red colored beautiful mobile phone .There were no head phones.  Pros: Full HD 6 inch Display is fantastic. Oppo AI features help in gaming and battery optimization 6GB RAM and 128 GB memory, Dual SIM and space for additional space for memory card is something very rare in this prizes. Face recognition for unlocking works with perfection Sound quality is good, I loved some songs on full volume in this phone No lag, no heat while playing games and multitasking, a great graphics. Due to optimized screen ratio, this phone easily fit in pocket though size is 6'0. Very lightweight. Cons: No diamond cut in Solar red model as shown in pic, it is plane plastic red with some shining on it. Back camera is average (not able to locate Bokeh mode yet) as this disappointed me more as Oppo is known for its better camera. No flash light in front camera Screen and back panel is left with smudges/finger prints after using for few minutes No C Type and fast charging No Fingerprint sensor  Verdict: A true treat who loves speed, AI, memory at this cost but camera lovers can avoid this.

{"rating": "4.0", "review": " Bought this for my dad. Below is my review after using it for 3 days.  Pros: - Display (9/10): Very good. Colours are well saturated and outdoor visibility is good. Automatic brightness is a bit aggressive at times, especially if the surrounding is a bit dark like a shadow the screen brightness goes to minimum which makes it harder to see the content. - Processor, RAM, SIM (9/10): Very good for the price. The phone is fast, really fast. The Helio processor is very good and on par with Snapdragon 636 which is in Redmi Note 5 Pro. I will suggest the 128 GB / 6 GB version as the extra RAM makes a lot of difference. It has dedicated dual sim and micros SD slot and not a hybrid one. A lot of manufacturers skip this. - Camera (8/10): Camera takes excellent pictures in good light. The portrait shot is a hit and miss. Night time the camera struggles with focus, especially if there is some movement of the hand or subject. Face unlock is very fast but can be easily fooled. - Battery (8/10): Although on paper it is less than other phones from Xiaomi, the processor is very efficient and hence you will get around 1 and half days of battery on average use (Messages, mails, calls, music, etc). - Audio (7/10): Audio quality is good, but not that loud. Samsung, Honor and Mi phones go louder. The head phone effects are good but does not sound right for all kinds of music, so if you are change to a different genre then you need to tinker with the effect setting. - Accessories (8/10): They provide screen guard and case which is very good. Normally after buying a phone from other brands you need to get this done in a store.  Cons: - No fingerprint sensor. Don't understand why, it's 2018, every other phone in the market has it. The face unlock is good but not as secure, you can place a photo of the person and it unlocks. - Color OS is not that good, I personally prefer MIUI which is more mature and closer to stock Android than other skins. Some default android features have been removed like Show Owner on Lock screen. - No notification icons. You will never know which app notifications are waiting from home screen, you need to pull down the top menu to see them. - Although the body is made of plastic fibre which seems tough, the front glass is susceptible to break. I have not tested it but not confident if it will last a drop.  Overall (8/10), in spite of the cons, I think it is a good value for the money phone. Definitely recommend it.  "},
